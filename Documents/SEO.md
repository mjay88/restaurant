Domain Authority

Most people studying Web Development have probably had a brush or two with SEO and may have a basic understanding of the concept, but just like most things, the more granular you get, the more complex things get. One the surface SEO is pretty straight forward ; we all know how to open our favorite search engine, type something in, and viola, we get results. SEO is basically how and why the results that popped up in your search did. Obvious search factors are relevance; search for puppies and you should expect to get search results for "puppies", not results for insurance or trying to get a loan, right? So lets say you search for "puppies", and you get a bunch of results back for puppies, what makes one sites headline of "puppies" more relevant the another sites headline of "puppies"? Search Engines and SEO firms use a system of ranking metrics to calculate the "credibility" of a site. The credibility of a site goes up when it features links to other credible sites, and when it is featured as a link on other similarly credible sites. Think of it it terms of credit from a bank. If you are in good standing with your lenders, you have a good credit score. People have loaned you money, and you paid it back with interest, so now you have equity and lenders know they can trust you. Your credit score goes up in relation to lenders trust in you. This is similar to how the credibility of a site works only instead of equity from money your site gets equity from linking to and being linked to from other credible sites. The more sites with high credibility that your site is associated with, the higher your sites ranking or credit score becomes, the higher the probability someone is likely to be led to your site from a search bar.
